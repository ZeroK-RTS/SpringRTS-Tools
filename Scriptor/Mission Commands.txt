Everything Listed here is pure speculation, the only way to be sure
would be to see an original Cavedog bos with such a command.

The mission command so far as I,ve seen has at least three parts:
  1. The first param is always a string. This string contains the
     the actual command to be performed and some additional parameters.
  2. After the string there is sometimes a few params, depending on
     what the string was.
  3. The mission command seems to return a value. When it doesn't there
     is a post command value of 0x10024000.

Mission Command stuff I've seen so far:

Mission Command - Create
-Possible Values in the String:
 *Unit Name   		ie "VERHAP"
-Values after the string:
 *Team        		ie 0
 *Map Coordinates	ie 245, 189
-Returns Value
*unitID

Mission Command - SetTrigger
-Possible Values in the String:
-Values after the string:
 *TriggerID   		ie 1
?*Map Coordinates	ie 245, 189 // Sometimes there are 3 numbers sometimes there are 4

Mission Command - RemoveTrigger

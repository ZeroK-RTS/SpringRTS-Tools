Disclaimer:

I assume no responsibility if your coputer explodes into flaming piles
of wreckage as a result of using my programs. That said, enjoy Scriptor
and DeScriptor. You can sell, distribute, pawn, mock, delete, claim
authorship, or do anything else with the programs that strikes your 
fancy.


Insatallation:

Umm... Unzip exe's and the .ini somewhere and execute em.
The Compiler.ini must be in the same dir as Scriptor.exe
Scriptor.exe and DeScriptor.exe are independent of each other so
you can put them in separate dirs.


Program Notes:

Scriptor:
Be sure to check what kind of .bos file you are compiling. TA or TAK
It does matter.
If there is a #define TA or #define TAK in your bos, it will override
the setting in the compiler.

DeScriptor:
There are a few options to consider.
 DeScripting Options
  Make Guesses: This lets DeScriptor try and guess on the statics and signals
  Show Inrement: Whenever DeScriptor finds something like a = a+1;
                 It will be replaced by ++a; Same for decrement.
  Large Numbers: DeScriptor will convert very large values found into
                 a Linear Value ie 163840 -> [1]
  Print returns: DeScriptor will print every return found in the cob

 Library Options
  Standard Libs: DeScriptor will replace a few standard scripts with 
                 it corresponding #include
  Animation Scripts: DeScriptor will separate these scripts into their
                     own file and replace them with an #include

 Debug Options
  Header Info:  Prints the .cob header at the beginning of the .bos
  Show Offsts:  Prints the script offset before each item in .bos
  Extra Info :  Prints pushes, jumps, operators etc...


----------
Known bugs
----------

Scriptor:

Still having some problems with post compilling cleanup. If you get an
error when compilling and then fix it, but another strange error or 
warning pops up, recompile again and it should work fine. When all else
fails, restart Scriptor and try again.

I've basicaly thrown nothing but valid code at the compiler so I
don't know how it react under other circumstances. Be warned.
